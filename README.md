# Johnny_Dep
Shows the dependency tree for a package using default Python setup.  
  
This script was made to demonstrate to a friend, Johnathan, how to obtain a pip dependency tree for a given package recursively by using Python default setup (libraries and pip installation).  
  
This script requires the package to first be installed via pip. I.e.:
```
pip install <package_name>
```
  
## Usage:  
```
python johnny_dep.py <package name>
```
